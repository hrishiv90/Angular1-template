## Coding Standards
	- View the samples for writing controllers, services and directives as given.
	- Use of tabs for indentation & not spaces (Tab size: 2).
	- Use config file to keep all dynamic/server related information.
	- Indentation with tabs.
	- No whitespace at the end of line or on blank lines.
	- Lines should usually be no longer than 80 characters, and should not exceed 100 (counting tabs as 4 spaces). This is a “soft” rule, but long lines generally indicate unreadable or disorganized code.
	- There should be a new line at the end of each file.
